Nearest Neighbor molecular entropy calculator using NN ANN library.
OpenMP and MPI versions plus two auxilliary program.
One for checking for data ties, and second for calculating Jacobian.
All complete programs are in the zip files. 
Other file are the content of the NN-Openmp version, which is already provided as zip file.
